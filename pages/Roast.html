        <h3>Roast Beef</h3>
        <img src="../images/Roast Beef.jpeg" style="width:250px; height:250px;">
        <p>Roast beef is a classic dish that has fast become one of my go-to dinner options. It’s easy to make, and when you know how to prepare a roast just right, you don’t need an expensive cut to make something fabulicious. The trick is in the seasoning and cooking technique to get that flavor-packed, mouthwatering juiciness.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>1 3-4-pound (1.5-2k) beef eye of round roast</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2-4 tablespoons (28-56 ml) olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ( 1 g) minced thyme</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons (2-4 g) paprika</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons (1-2 g) rosemary, minced</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon (1 g) cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic whole, for stuffing</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons (28g-42g) butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (235ml) dry red wine, Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml)beef broth</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Rinse roast, pat dry beef, and then season it with salt and pepper.
                Mix the olive oil or butter, thyme, paprika, rosemary,<li>
            <li>minced garlic, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Rub it all over the beef roast, covering every inch of it with marinade. Put it in a ziplock bag or cover it in a bowl. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Drain the marinade and set it aside when you're ready to roast it. Remove any herbs or spices from the cook the roast.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut deep slits all over the roast. Then stuff the slits with the cloves of garlic.<li>
            <li>Melt butter or add oil to a pan and heat over medium-high heat, searing the roast on all sides until slightly brown—about 3-4 minutes on each side. That will help hold the juices and set the crust.</li>
            <li>Place in the desired oven-safe casserole or cast iron pot. If desired, add vegetables at the bottom of the dish, and place beef on top of vegetables.</li>
            <li>Cook the roast in a preheated 250℉/120℃ oven for 1-2 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 130-140℉/55-60℃. Please remember that the cooking time varies depending on the roast's shape, size, and desired doneness.<li>
            <li>While the beef is roasting, heat the reserved marinade in a small saucepan and add red wine and beef broth over medium-high heat. Then lower the heat and simmer until reduced and slightly thickened. Add butter and adjust salt and pepper to taste.<li>
            <li>Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute evenly throughout the roast before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve with mashed potatoes or make roast beef sandwiches.</ol>
